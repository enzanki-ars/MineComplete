various things such as picking up or crafting new items, earning advancements, 
and more. 

## Warning

This project is not ready for play testing at the moment. Many actions are 
missing from the list, and completing the action before it is added to the game 
could lead to difficulty in earning the points.  

### Known issues

* Brewing and smelting does not count as a new item.

## Points

For each type of action, points will only be awarded once for the action. 
Repeating the action will not earn the player any additional points.
